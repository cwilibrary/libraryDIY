# Read Me  

This is still a work in progress. The goal is to make a version of [Portland State University's Library DIY](https://library.pdx.edu/diy) project that can be hosted through GitHub Pages & built with Jekyll. The version I'm currently localizing is [Indiana University Bloomington's Library DIY](http://guides.libraries.indiana.edu/diy), which is hosted & built through SpringShare's LibGuides platform.
